                <img src="images/425911_preview.png" alt="">
                <p>Bangladeshis love to eat fish,this is one of the main staples, especially in the
                    cities and especially freshwater fish.

                    The most common fish is carp fish. It is a white fish and It is quite
                    nutritious. Carp fish is often served fried or as a whole fish baked in the oven. Because it is
                    really
                    boney, it is quite a lot of effort to eat it.</p>

                <p>Pitha refers to traditional home made cakes in Bangladesh. Many kinds of pithas are made not as a
                    part of
                    the daily menu. But these are served on special occasions such as receiving bridegrooms or brides,
                    entertaining guests, and arranging special get together of family members, relatives or friends.
                    Sometimes children or senior members of the family especially ask for pithas and accordingly,
                    mothers or
                    grandmothers make different type of pithas for them. In some cases, neighbouring families jointly
                    make
                    pithas and use the occasion for chatting and having lunch or dinner together.
                    Most pithas are sweet and a few are chilly. Some are made throughout the year but some are seasonal.
                    Pithas of the winter season are the most delicious. Date juice and molasses from date juice and
                    sugarcane are available in the winter season. These are important ingredients of pithas that are
                    loved
                    by people of almost all regions of Bangladesh. The pitha season in Bangladesh starts in late autumn,
                    when farmers harvest paddy from the field.</p>
